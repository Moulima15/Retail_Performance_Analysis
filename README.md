2.** Regional Insights :** Profit can be improved through targeted marketing or promotions in Central & South to close the performance gap. 
3.** Customer Segment Insights :** Corporate and Home Office segments can grow with bulk discounts, partnerships or loyalty programs. 
4.** Monthly Sales & Profit Trend Insights :** Planning for inventory and staffing around peak seasons is crucial to maximize sales and avoid stockouts. 
5. **Category Insights :** Technology drives the highest sales and profit. Furniture and Office Supplies should be checked for cost efficiency.
